# building_war
data + code for building war from first principles (SAG WAR Room meeting 1)

## Data Credit
None of the data contained in here is ours. Credit is owed to the great:  
- Lahman database for batting and fielding stats every year
- Fangraphs for advanced fielding stats and wOBA + park factor GUTS!
- Baseball Reference for 2025 WAR baseline
- Chadwick persons registry for matching IDs between fangraphs, Lahman/bref, and retrosheet (among other standards)
